# Duke Student Government: Spring 2021 Waste Audit

**Date**: Spring 2021<br>

## Abstract

The results of the Spring 2021 Waste Audit revealed a large proportion of
missorted waste in both recycling and landfill bins. These results indicate
that students are unable to properly sort their waste due to a lack of
information. It is necessary to provide students with an educational campaign
concentrating on how to sort recycling and trash, as well as compost. Over
half of the waste in recycling and trash bins was compostable; this large
volume of compost demonstrates that students need more widespread access
to composting following the success of additional education. We encourage
annual waste audits to monitor progress and ascertain success.

## Codebook for Relevant Variables

The 'waste_audit_sp2021' data set has been collected by the Duke Student
Government Services and Sustainability Committee and volunteers. The data was
collected on April 5, 2021, 12:00-16:30. The location of all of the trash and
recycle bins from which we extracted is on the main Plaza on Duke University's
West Campus.

- `can_number`: unique identifying label (number) to distinguish between bins
- `pieces_trash`: number of pieces in a bin resorted as landfill
- `pieces_recycle`: number of pieces in a bin resorted as recyclable
- `pieces_compost`: number of pieces in a bin resorted as compostable
- `total_piece_volume`: total number of pieces in a bin
- `weight_trash`: weight (lbs) of resorted landfill pieces in a bin
- `weight_recycle`: weight (lbs) of resorted recyclable pieces in a bin
- `weight_compost`: weight (lbs) or resorted compostable pieces in a bin
- `total_can_weight`: total weight (lbs) of a bin
- `prop_pieces_trash`: proportion of total resorted pieces that were landfill
- `prop_pieces_recycle`: proportion of total resorted pieces that were recyclable
- `prop_pieces_compost`: proportion of total resorted pieces that were compostable
- `prop_trash_weight`: proportion of total resorted weight that was landfill
- `prop_recycle_weight`: proportion of total resorted weight that was recyclable
- `prop_compost_weight`: proportion of total resorted weight that was compostable
- `original_stream`: original waste stream designation (e.g. trash, recycling)
- `multiple_streams_bin`: bin was pulled from a multi-stream waste receptacle (Boolean)
- `big_belly_compactor`: bin was pulled from Big Belly Compactor (Boolean)
- `near_stairwell`: bin is located near stairwell mouth (Boolean)
- `near_exit`: bin is located near exit door (Boolean)
- `near_seating`: bin is located near student outdoor seating (Boolean)
- `top_level`: bin is located on the top level of the Plaza or on the Bridge (Boolean)
- `x_coordinate`: approximate x-coordinate of bin location
- `y_coordinate`: approximate y-coorindate of bin location
- `collection time`: time samples were collected

Thank you to **Morgan Bachman**, Sustainability Coordinator at Duke University,
for making this project possible. Her help in organizing the waste audit,
providing us the necessary resources, and communicating with Duke administration
proved invaluable to creating this opportunity for Duke Student Government to
investigate waste practices and knowledge on campus. She gave us the "yes" that
we needed.

Thank you to our volunteers: **Leah Roffman**, **Gurnoor Majhail**, **Hana**
**Hendi**, **Rishab Jagetia**, **Dawei Gao**, **Sawyer O'Keefe**, **Aashna**
**Sawhney**, **Andrew McCallum**, **Adam Kosinski**, **Arianna Dwomoh**,
**Rosa Golchin**, **Shirley Mathur**, and **Julia Murphy**. These extraordinary
students volunteered their time on a Monday to sort through trash and
recyclables -- a task that demonstrates an unrelenting dedication to improving
waste infrastructure on campus and true grit. Not only did we accomplish
something on April 5, but this group of students was able to enjoy themselves
and make light of a very dirty day.

Thank you to Professor Shawn Santo and Rob Kravec for assisting in the
statistical analysis and the betterment of our data gathering technique.

Thank you to Duke Student Government for supporting us along the way. Vice
President of DSG's Services and Sustainability Committee **Zac Johnson** gave us
enthusiastic encouragement and helped guide and fine-tune our communication with
administration. DSG President **Tommy Hessel** and Treasurer **William Xie**
gave us their time and a platform to obtain additional funding from the DSG
Discretionary Fund.

Thank you Duke Students for your interest in our project and results. We love
you.
